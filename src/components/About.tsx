              When I’m not coaching, the same focus, consistency, discipline, and self-accountability that fueled my career as a pro athlete continue to drive me. My approach to preparation keeps me aligned with my core values, whether I’m training in the gym, getting reps on the court, or guiding others in their personal growth. I’ve learned that success is built in the quiet moments of repetition and discipline. That’s why I bring the same intensity and passion to creating safe spaces for lifestyle development as I do to my own training. Every rep, on and off the court - is a step toward building the champion mindset.
